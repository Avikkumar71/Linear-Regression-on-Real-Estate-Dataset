# Linear-Regression-on-Real-Estate-Dataset
Linear Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning Model for finding the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. 
Linear regression performs the task to predict the response (dependent) variable value (y) based on a given (independent) explanatory variable (x). 
So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y (output).

Problem Statement â€“ A real state agents want help to predict the house price for regions in the USA.
He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use the Linear Regression Model.
Consider the dataset before Normalization, find MAE, MSE, RMSE
Apply Normalization find MAE, MSE, RMSE

The dataset contains 7 columns and 415 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

1. X1 Trancation date
2. X2 house age
3. X3 distance to the nearest MRT station
4. X4 number of convenience stores
5. X5 latitude
6. X6 longitude
7. Y house price of unit area
